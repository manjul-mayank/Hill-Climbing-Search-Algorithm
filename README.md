# 🌄 Hill Climbing Algorithm – AI Search Technique

This repository contains an implementation of the **Hill Climbing algorithm** for solving optimization problems using a local search strategy. This project was developed as part of an AI course assignment focused on heuristic search methods.

## 🧠 What is Hill Climbing?

Hill Climbing is a heuristic search algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution and iteratively makes small changes to improve it. If a change produces a better solution, the algorithm continues from that new point.

This algorithm is commonly used in:
- Pathfinding
- Constraint satisfaction
- Optimization problems
