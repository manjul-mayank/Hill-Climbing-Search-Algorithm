A local search algorithm tries to find the optimal solution by exploring the states in
the local region. Hill climbing is a local search technique that constantly looks for a
better solution in its neighborhood.
1. Implement the Hill Climbing Search Algorithm for solving the 8-puzzle
2. problem.
Check the algorithm for the following heuristics:
a. h1(n) = number of tiles displaced from their destined position.
b. h2(n) = sum of the Manhattan distance of each tile from the goal
position.

## üß† What is Hill Climbing?

Hill Climbing is a heuristic search algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution and iteratively makes small changes to improve it. If a change produces a better solution, the algorithm continues from that new point.

This algorithm is commonly used in:
- Pathfinding
- Constraint satisfaction
- Optimization problems
